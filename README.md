# Anime Pulse

Anime Pulse is a web application developed to showcase my skills in React.js. It utilizes a free API to fetch anime details, displaying a list of currently streaming top anime. Users can click on an anime image to view more details. The project incorporates several features, including a dark mode toggle, dynamic routing, page animations using Framer Motion, and a responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
